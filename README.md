# django-restful-ember-testbed
This is a project to demonstrate how [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) , the [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)  and [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/)  can be used together to produce a single page application.

This project provides the back-end and the front-end may be seen in my other project [ember-django-testbed](https://github.com/shearichard/ember-django-testbed).
